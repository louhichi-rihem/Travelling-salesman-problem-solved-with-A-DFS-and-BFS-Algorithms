# Travelling-salesman-problem-solved-with-A-DFS-and-BFS-Algorithms

Travelling salesman problem : detect the shortest path to cross from node A to node B 
 
Calculate the distances using A*, DFS and BFS and compare each result .

In our case A* gave the shortest distance.

*the edges are bidirectionnelle.
*the graph is customized
